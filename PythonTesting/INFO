Includes the test files I've used to check and see how the TCP communication works in Python.

server.py
~~~~~~~~~

When run with the command promt, sends a string over tcp to target adress and port.
Stopped with Ctrl-C interrupt.

Running arguments:
-a , --address	The adress for the tcp server to write to. For example: '127.0.0.1'
-p , --port	The port for the tcp server to write to. For example: '12002'
-s , --text	The string of text for the server to send. For example: 'sharks with frikin lasers'

client.py
~~~~~~~~~

When run with the command promt, shows a string received via a tcp connection. Writes its buffer
every 0.5 seconds. Stopped with Ctrl-C interrupt.

Running arguments:
-a , --address	The adress for the tcp server to listen to. For example: '127.0.0.1'
-p , --port	The port for the tcp server to listen to. For example: '12002'
