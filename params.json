{"name":"SmartBot","tagline":"The compelete repository for the open-source robot using Raspberry Pi and Arduino","body":"### Welcome to the SmartBot Site on GitHub\r\nSmartbot is an open-source Raspberry Pi and Arduino- powered robot that can run around in your house, either controlled by a program or manually.\r\nOh yes, and it's streaming live video footage!\r\n![The robot after assembly](http://cdn.instructables.com/FYO/JMF1/IE42Q63X/FYOJMF1IE42Q63X.LARGE.jpg)\r\n### What is \"Raspberry Pi\" and \"Arduino\"?\r\nRaspberry Pi and Arduino are two electronic boards developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Arduino LLC, respectively. Raspberry Pi (RPi for short) si a whole computer at the size of a credit card! It can control devices such as motors, LEDs and sensors.\r\nArduino is a small micro-controller. Essentially, a great tool for people who want to make simple light and straightforward project.\r\n\r\n### Can I Make It?\r\nOf course! Raspberry Pi and Arduino are relatively cheap and rest of the components are a few dollars.\r\nFor a complete tutorial and explanation, visit the Instructable that will be linked in about a week.\r\n### How Does It Work?\r\nWell, there are three platforms for this project:\r\n* A Personal Computer. It receives the live footage taken by the Raspberry Pi on-board the robot. It is the one that sends signals to the Raspberry Pi\r\n* In turn, the RPi gets signals from the computer and then processes them using a clever program. This signals are then sent to the...\r\n* Arduino that reads the raw signals from the sensors and sends raw signals to the motors.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI'm @RedPhantom, a 14 years old student from Israel learning in the Max Shein Junior High School for Advanced Science and Mathematics. I'm making this project for everyone to learn from and share!\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf there's any problem with the software, just submit a ticket and we will find out whatâ€™s wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br /><span xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" href=\"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text\" property=\"dct:title\" rel=\"dct:type\">SmartBot Website</span> by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"epaca.pe.hu/itay/\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">Itay Asayag</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
