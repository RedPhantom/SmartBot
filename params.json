{"name":"Smartbot","tagline":"The compelete repository for the open-source robot using Raspberry Pi and Arduino","body":"### Welcome to the SmartBot Site on GitHub\r\nSmartbot is an open-source Raspberry Pi and Arduino- powered robot that can run around in your house, either controlled by a program or manually.\r\nOh yes, and it's streaming live video footage!\r\n\r\n### What is \"Raspberry Pi\" and \"Arduino\"?\r\nRaspberry Pi and Arduino are two electronic boards developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Arduino LLC, respectively. Raspberry Pi (RPi for short) si a whole computer at the size of a credit card! It can control devices such as motors, LEDs and sensors.\r\nArduino is a small micro-controller. Essentially, a great tool for people who want to make simple light and straightforward project.\r\n\r\n### Can I Make It?\r\nOf course! Raspberry Pi and Arduino are releativeley cheap and rest of the components are a few dollars.\r\nFor a complete tutorial and explanation, visit the Instructable that will be linked in about a week.\r\n### How Does It Work?\r\nWell, there are three platforms for this project:\r\n* A Personal Computer. It receives the live footage taken by the Raspberry Pi on-board the robot. It is the one that sends signals to the Raspberry Pi\r\n* In turn, the RPi gets signals from the computer and then processes them using a clever program. This signals are then sent to the...\r\n* Arduino that reads the raw signals from the sensors and sends raw signals to the motors\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI'm @RedPhantom, a 14 years old student from Israel learning in the Max Shein Junior High School for Advanced Science and Mathematics. I'm making this project for everyone to learn from and share!\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf there's any problem with the software, just submit a ticket and we will find out whatâ€™s wrong.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
