<p>Smartbot is an open-source Raspberry Pi and Arduino- powered robot that can run around in your house, either controlled by a program or manually.
Oh yes, and it's streaming live video footage!

<p>Raspberry Pi and Arduino are two electronic boards developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Arduino LLC, respectively. Raspberry Pi (RPi for short) si a whole computer at the size of a credit card! It can control devices such as motors, LEDs and sensors.
Arduino is a small micro-controller. Essentially, a great tool for people who want to make simple light and straightforward project.</p>

<a id="can-i-make-it" class="anchor" href="#can-i-make-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Can I Make It?</h3>

<p>Of course! Raspberry Pi and Arduino are relatively cheap and rest of the components are a few dollars.
For a complete tutorial and explanation, visit the Instructable that will be linked in about a week.</p>

<a id="how-does-it-work" class="anchor" href="#how-does-it-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How Does It Work?</h3>

<p>Well, there are three platforms for this project:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Personal Computer. It receives the live footage taken by the Raspberry Pi on-board the robot. It is the one that sends signals to the Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>In turn, the RPi gets signals from the computer and then processes them using a clever program. This signals are then sent to the...</li>
<li>Arduino that reads the raw signals from the sensors and sends raw signals to the motors.</li>
</ul>
